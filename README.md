# Youtube Shorts Timebar

Youtube Shorts Timebar is a Chrome extension that lets you navigate Youtube shorts' time.

## Installation

Simply download the folder and use the "Locate Unpacked" in the "Manage extensions" in Chrome.


## Next Step
There's currently a problem with the navigation between "youtube.com/shorts" and other parts of Youtube where either the bar is showing in regular Youtube or it's not showing in the Shorts section.
