# Youtube Shorts Timebar

Youtube Shorts Timebar is a Chrome extension that lets you navigate Youtube shorts' time.

## Installation

* Download the ZIP file, and extract its content.

* Open the Chrome browser and go to the Extensions page. You can access this page by clicking on the three dots in the upper-right corner of the browser window and selecting "More tools" > "Extensions".

* Enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the upper-right corner of the Extensions page.

* Drag and drop the folder you just extracted earlier onto the Extensions page. Alternatively, you can click on the "Load unpacked" button in the upper-left corner of the Extensions page and select the folder containing the extracted extension files.

* A confirmation dialog box will appear, asking you if you want to add the extension. Click "Add extension" to confirm.

* The extension should now be installed and ready to use. You can access it by clicking on its icon in the Chrome toolbar.

## Next Step
There's currently a problem with the navigation between "youtube.com/shorts" and other parts of Youtube where either the bar is showing in regular Youtube or it's not showing in the Shorts section.
